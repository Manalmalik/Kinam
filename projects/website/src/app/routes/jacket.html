<p>The Mayas are one of the most fascinating civilizations in human history. They achieved great progress in many fields, and were centuries ahead of Western civilization in some of their discoveries. Their legacy can be seen in numerous aspects of daily life, such as in mathematics, astronomy, farming, language, art and architecture. For instance, the Mayas created one of the first ever recorded concept of zero, and developed a unique numbering system using only dots and lines, which was more advanced than any other number system at that time. They also invented a highly sophisticated writing system composed of beautiful symbols known as maya glyphs. The most iconic symbol remaining today are their impressive temples, built on pyramids and dedicated to their gods.</p>
