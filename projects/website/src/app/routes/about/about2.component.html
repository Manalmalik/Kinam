        The idea for KINAM was born in 2013 in Guatemala as a way to celebrate the ancient Maya traditions and create a steady income independent from tourism to aid impoverished indigenous tribes. After moving to Berlin in 2017, Oshko met Nicolas at a QUARTERS Co-Living party and shared goals and visions for the future. Nicolas dreamt of founding a music label and media production company with childhood friends Christopher and Orhan. Oshko loved the idea, and proposed to join forces to create KINAM.
<br><br>
Soon after, the four co-founders traveled to Guatemala to shoot content for the crowdfunding video, record live audio from the jungle for an electronic music album inspired by the Maya culture, and find a product for their brand. They decided on handwoven jackets, produced in collaboration between Maya descendant artisans and Berlin product experts, to tell the stories of the Mayas in a sleek, stylish way. In the past 8 months, the team has grown to 30 members across 7 countries, creating a global, loving network thrilled to bring the Maya textile art to the world.
