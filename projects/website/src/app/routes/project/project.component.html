<h1>Education Through Football</h1>

With KINAM’s social projects, we aim to build pride and appreciation for the Maya culture amongst younger generations
and equip them with the necessary tools for future success. Our three first projects are: education and skill-building
through football, re-introduction of Maya art by teaching descendants how to read and write in original Glyphs, and
financing Maya archeological projects to uncover lost treasures. Another long-term goal in the pipeline is to create
volunteer participation projects for people from all around the world whereby we can stimulate an even greater cultural
exchange. There is an opportunity for social projects in Guatemala to have a true impact, to preserve and protect the
rich ancient Maya culture.


<h2>Situation </h2>

Football plays a big role in Guatemala ́s culture and represents a positive distraction from a rough everyday-life for
many people, especially younger generations. However, suitable and safe spaces, appropriate equipment, and qualified
coaches with pedagogical skills are rare. The social potential of football remains largely undisclosed / hidden.

<h2>Complication</h2>

Due to impoverished living conditions, things that are deemed essential for survival are at the focus of most families ́
efforts. As many children need to work in order to contribute to that, the built-up energy inside them often ends up
being released in acts of violence or vandalism. Football is not yet regarded as instrumental in learning essential
life-skills within the communities.

<h2>Solution</h2>

Football is an accessible and effective motor for positive social change. Local coaches are trained to apply established
methods in their programs, promoting values like mutual respect, fair-play, and a sense of collective responsibility.
Football is used as the “hook” to draw otherwise hard-to-reach children into further educational programs - playing in
exchange for learning. Like a game of football, the program is composed of two halves. 45 minutes of play plus 45
minutes of education add up to 90 minutes of preparing for a better future. Receiving extensive training and being given
various responsibilities, local coaches and participants feel empowered, a sense of project ownership is created, and a
generation of well-equipped future leaders emerges in Guatemalan communities.
