                                            With KINAM’s social projects, we aim to build pride and appreciation for the Maya culture amongst 
                                            younger generations and equip them with the necessary tools for future success. In the initial 
                                            stage, we will support existing NGOs that we have partnered with to facilitate social impact 
                                            projects in Guatemala. The goal is to build as many local networks as possible and learn about 
                                            the concrete needs of people, as well as best practices in successfully helping the Maya 
                                            communities on the ground.

                                            <br>Another long-term goal is to create volunteer participation projects whereby we can stimulate an even 
                                            greater cultural exchange. There is an opportunity for social projects in Guatemala to have a true impact,

                                Football plays a big role in Guatemala ́s culture and represents a positive distraction
                                from a rough everyday-life for many people, especially younger generations. However,
                                suitable and safe spaces, appropriate equipment, and qualified coaches with pedagogical
                                skills are rare. The social potential of football remains largely undisclosed / hidden.

                                Due to impoverished living conditions, things that are deemed essential for survival are
                                at the focus of most families ́ efforts. As many children need to work in order to
                                contribute to that, the built-up energy inside them often ends up being released in acts
                                of violence or vandalism. Football is not yet regarded as instrumental in learning
                                essential life-skills within the communities.

                                Football is an accessible and effective motor for positive social change. Local coaches
                                are trained to apply established methods in their programs, promoting values like mutual
                                respect, fair-play, and a sense of collective responsibility. Football is used as the
                                “hook” to draw otherwise hard-to-reach children into further educational programs -
                                playing in exchange for learning. Like a game of football, the program is composed of
                                two halves. 45 minutes of play plus 45 minutes of education add up to 90 minutes of
                                preparing for a better future. Receiving extensive training and being given various
                                responsibilities, local coaches and participants feel empowered, a sense of project
                                ownership is created, and a generation of well-equipped future leaders emerges in
                                Guatemalan communities

                            <p>During 30 years of civil war in Guatemala, a generational gap of Maya descendants, who are not able to read and write in their original maya language, was created. For 30 years they suffered oppression and where obligated to learn Spanish as their main language. A vast majority of them spread into the highlands of Guatemala to hide from the guerrillas and the army. They assembled there and have been surviving for decades without access to proper education. As a consequence, the majority of the Maya descendants have lost the ability to interpret reading and writing in their original Maya glyph language.

                            <div class="poff"> <b>Problem </b></div>

                            <p>The Maya descendant communities of Guatemala are lacking the resources for them to prosper and conserve their culture. The absence of basic human necessities are forcing large numbers of people to migrate to the US illegally with the hope of finding jobs that enable them to provide a better future for themselves. This dream for a better future outside of the country drives them to risk their lives and their childrens making the trip to the US border on foot, crossing rivers and desserts, facing the dangers of human trafficking and sexual violence.

                            <p>Alongside Maya archeology experts and the local communities of Maya descendants, we want to create awareness of the importance of learning and conserving the Maya glyph language. By enabling locals to re-learn the traditional maya language, we want to provide them with the opportunity to have access to new and better jobs being created in the archeological sector. The phase 1 of this project entails creating workshops that teach the Maya-decendants how to read and write in Maya glyphs. The idea is to combine compact theoretical sessions with extensive periods of practice and implementation. The first project will aim at designing murals with local communities to put into practice what they have learned and via decorating the facades of public buildings, parks and private houses.

                            <p>In 2017, Mayan archeologists & technology experts from Guatemala and the United States mounted advanced laser scanners onto helicopters to create the biggest ever 3D survey of the rainforest in Guatemala in order to find out how much of the more than 3500-year-old civilization is still hidden underneath the canopy of the jungle today. The results were mind-blowing: The laser scans uncovered the ruins of more than 60,000 objects that could be houses, palaces, elevated highways, or other human-made features - an incredible scientific treasure waiting to be uncovered and shared with the world. 

                            </p>
                            <div class="poff"> <b>Problem </b></div>

                            <p>Those who have been to the jungle of guatemala know that due to the vegetation and climate it is incredibly strenuous and time-consuming to travel, let alone to excavate archaeologically. For this reason the same scientists who created the LIDAR maps assume that the exploration of the 60000 objects will not take years, but generations, and will require a great deal of resources, time and people.  

                            </p>
                            <div class="poff"> <b>Solution</b></div>

                            <p>Together with our own team of Maya archeologists, scientific research institutions in Germany and Guatemala as well as other public and private organizations, we want to help discover and preserve the cultural treasures of the Mayas. KINAM wants to become a long-term partner providing resources, people, media production and marketing capabilities to archeological projects in the jungle of Guatemala for many years to come. Similar to what companies like RedBull have achieved in the realm of extreme sports, KINAM wants to give archeology and science the global stage in terms of media quality and coverage it deserves. This will not only help generate the global awareness and excitement needed, but also create well-paying jobs for Maya-descendants working in these projects. We are currently in the process of developing the first official discovery missions, together with public universities and researchers from Germany and will provide details about our first mission about 2-3 months after the crowdfunding campaign.
