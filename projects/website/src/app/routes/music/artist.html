     KINAM’s mission is to share meaningful stories through music, products and digital content. That is why the co-founders of KINAM decided to combine design, fashion, music and video production to form a new, integrated, social impact brand. The journey took the team to Guatemala, to record live sounds from the jungle to tell the legends of the ancient Maya civilization and shoot the crowdfunding video for the entire project. They aim to completely immerse the listener into the Maya world with music based on actual legends described in the Maya’s sacred scripture, the “popol vuh”, artworks portraying the stories’ iconic scenery and a comprehensible version of the story to read on their website. As for all KINAM incomes, 10% of all streaming revenues will go back to Guatemala to support the social projects of KINAM.
