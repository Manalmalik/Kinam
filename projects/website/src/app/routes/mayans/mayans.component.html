                Having constructed complex cities in the deepest and sheer unreachable parts of the jungle, 
                the ancient Mayas are until today one of the most fascinating and still undiscovered civilizations
                 in human history. The Mayan civilization developed in an area that encompasses all of Guatemala 
                 and Belize, southeastern Mexico, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador. The first 
                 Maya cities developed around 750 BC, and by 500 BC these cities possessed monumental architecture,
                 including large temples with elaborate façades. Their legacy can be seen in numerous other aspects
                 of daily life, such as in astronomy, mathematics, farming, language, and art.
                They achieved great progress in many fields and were sometimes centuries ahead of Western 
                civilizations in some of their discoveries. For instance, the Mayas created one of the first-ever 
                recorded concepts of zero and developed a unique numbering system using only dots and lines, which 
                was more advanced than any other number system at that time. They also invented a highly 
                sophisticated writing system composed of beautiful symbols known as Maya glyphs. The most iconic 
                symbol remaining today are the impressive temples in the jungle, built on pyramids and dedicated 
                to their gods.
                
                It’s thanks to the Mayas that we eat corn, beans, squash, chili pepper, amaranth, and many other 
                staple crops. Their farming methods were both sustainable and highly functional, only hunting and 
                planting the necessary amount to feed their large and diverse populations. Caring for the community, 
                rather than the individual, was always of utmost importance to them. The Mayas were very 
                ceremonial people and believed in the supernatural. They performed rituals to worship the gods 
                and their ancestors to bring them goodwill. Above all, the Mayas believe in respect and love for 
                all life, cultures and traditions. They strive for a symbiotic relationship with nature and seek 
                to live harmoniously with everything around them. 
                
                In 2017, Maya archeologists and technology experts from Guatemala and the United States mounted 
                advanced laser scanners onto helicopters to create the biggest ever 3D survey of the jungle in 
                order to find out how much of the ancient civilization is still hidden underneath the jungle 
                canopy today. The results were shocking: The laser scans uncovered the ruins of more than 60,000 
                structures that could be entire cities, houses, palaces, elevated highways, and other human-made 
                features - an incredible amount of scientific knowledge and cultural beauty which is now waiting to be discovered and shared with the world.
