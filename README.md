## Important
The folder "legacy" contains components which we do not need right now. However, geel free to explore!

## Start App:

`npm install`

`npm run build:all`

`npm start`

## Deploy App:

`npm run deploy:website`

## Routes:
`/`:                Landing

`/playbook`:        Playbook

## PRojects:
`core`:             Contains modules needed for the root component (e.g. HttpClientModule)

`shared`:           Contains modules needed for every new module (e.g. FormsModule)

`nahual-date`:      Contains a class which calculates Nawales

`ng-maya-birthday`: Contains a component which represents Maya numbers

`website`:          This is where we will work until we launch. Then we refactor into the above

## TODO:
[] Finish implementaion of landing

[] Replace Nawales
