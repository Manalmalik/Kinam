## Start App:
`npm install`
`npm run build:all`
`npm start`

## Routes:
`/`:                Landing
`/playbook`:        Playbook

## PRojects:
`core`:             Contains modules needed for the root component (e.g. HttpClientModule)
`shared`:           Contains modules needed for every new module (e.g. FormsModuele)
`nahual-date`:      Contains a class which calculates Nawales
`ng-maya-birthday`: Contains a component which represents Maya numbers
`website`:          This is where we will work until we launch. Then we refactor into the above

## TODO:
[] Finish implementaion of landing
[] Replace Nawales
